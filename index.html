      Burning, shattering and cutting drama in our kitchen

      <h2>Shattering cookware</h2>
      <p>
        More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot handles
        can burn and sometimes glass cookware can shatter.

      <h2>Knife cuts</h2>
      <p>
        Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen type)
        affected more than 350,000 people in 2012, according to the Consumer
        Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually more dangerous than
        sharp ones, because they require more pressure to use and their worn
        edge can cause the knife to slip off food and into your fingers.

      <h2>Contact Burns From Equipment</h2>
      <p>
        The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an open fire
        like our ancestors did; we have a nifty box that keeps the heat
        contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all that heat combined
        with metal components and cookware leads to loads of burns. Quick tips
        (which are obvious, but good to keep in mind): Always use oven mitts,
        replace them when they’re old; don’t use a wet towel as an oven mitt;
        don’t reach your arm in to check baked goods, pull out the rack to test

      <h2>Microwave oven burns</h2>
      <p>
        More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves. Burns were most
        common.

      <h2>Cooking fires</h2>
      <p>
        Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five reported
        home fires. Unattended cooking equipment accounts for one in three
        fires, and half are ignited by fat, grease, oil, or related substances,
        according to the National Fire Protection Association.

      <h2>Death to the Pathogens</h2>
      <p>
        The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking in
        your food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
        estimates that each year roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million
        people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne
        diseases. The top five culprits sending Americans to the hospital are
        salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and E.coli
        – but much can be done in terms of proper food handling, cooking and
        storage to help prevent these pathogens from causing illness.
